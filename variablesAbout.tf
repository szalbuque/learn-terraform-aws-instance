# contains information of variables used in main.tf
# Variables on Terraform are a great way to pack your configuration with easily readable data. 
# When you declare variables in the root module of your configuration, you can set their values using CLI options 
# and environment variables. When you declare them in child modules, the calling module should pass values 
# in the module block.
